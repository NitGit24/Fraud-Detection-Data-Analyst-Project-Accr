# Fraud Detection Case Study

This project is my solution for a financial fraud detection business case.  
It builds a machine learning pipeline to predict fraudulent transactions from a dataset (6.3M Ã— 10).

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- `Fraud_Detection_Solution.ipynb` â†’ end-to-end notebook (EDA, preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, insights).
- `outputs/` â†’ model artifacts, metrics, and plots.
- `Data Dictionary.txt` â†’ dataset schema.
- `Fraud.csv` â†’ dataset (not included in repo due to size; download separately).

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone repo:
